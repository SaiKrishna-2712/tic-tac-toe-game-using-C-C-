# tic-tac-toe-game-using-C/C++
In this game, two players alternately put X’s and O’s in compartments of a tic tac toe board and each tries to get a row of three X’s or three O’s before the opponent does.
The project, "C++ Tic-Tac-Toe Game," is a fun and interactive game that was developed using the C++ programming language.
The game is designed for two players and is played on the console displayed on the screen.
The objective of the game is for players to place their respective markers (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three markers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
The project helped me to gain a deeper understanding and familiarity with the C++ language and its capabilities. 
I was able to implement various C++ concepts such as loops, conditionals, and functions, to create a fully functional game. 
Additionally, I was able to design a menu on the console, providing a user-friendly interface for the players to navigate and play the game. 
This skill in creating a menu on the console was also beneficial in my future projects. Overall, the project is a great way to learn and practice C++ programming while also having fun. 
It provides a great opportunity to improve problem-solving skills and logic while also learning how to create a simple but engaging game.
